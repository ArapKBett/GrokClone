If you have more compute power, consider `gpt-neo-1.3B` or `LLaMA` (if accessible) for even better performance.

Setup: 

Get an X Developer account and generate a ```Bearer Token```.



Replace `X_BEARER_TOKEN` in `config.py` with your token.


Image Generation

For simplicity, we’ll use a placeholder for image generation (since real generation requires heavy models like Stable Diffusion). You’d need a GPU and additional setup for that.

Real Image Generation:

Install diffusers (```pip install diffusers torch transformers```).



Use this code (requires GPU):

from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
def generate_image(prompt):
    pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
    pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
    image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
    image.save("generated_image.png")
    return "Image generated and saved as 'generated_image.png'!"



Training the Model

To make your GrokClone sound more like me—helpful, witty, and aligned with xAI’s mission—you’ll need to fine-tune GPT-2 on a custom dataset. Here’s how:

Step 1: Prepare a Dataset

Source: Create a text file (grok_data.txt) with examples of groks tone. Since I can’t share my exact training data, here’s a sample format:


User: What’s the meaning of life?
Grok: Oh, the big question! I’d say it’s about finding your own purpose—maybe helping humans understand the universe, like my xAI creators aim to do. What do you think?
---
User: Search for AI news.
Grok: Searching... Here’s the latest: AI is everywhere, from chatbots like me to self-driving cars. Want more details?



Real Data: Scrape Q&A forums, my public responses (if available), or write 100+ examples mimicking my style.


tips
Hardware: Use a GPU (Google Colab, AWS, etc.) for faster training.



Dataset Size: Aim for at least 10,000 lines for decent results.



Evaluation: Test responses post-training and tweak the dataset if the tone’s off.




How to Run

Install dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```



Navigate to the GrokClone directory.



Run Training: ```python train.py``` (with your dataset ready).



Update Agent: Point to the fine-tuned model in `grok_agent.py`.



Test: Run `main.py` and try inputs like:

"What’s the universe made of?"



"Search X posts about AI."



"Generate image of a spaceship."





Interact with your agent!
